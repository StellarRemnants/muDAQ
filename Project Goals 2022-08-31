== muDAQ Goals ==

- Full thermocouple (TC) support for acquisition and analysis
	- Needed for vertical flow velocity (VFV) sensing

- Heat flux sensor (HFS) support

- Displacement sensor (DpS) support

- Full multidevice integration for acquisition and analysis
	- Allows for extension of channel count without needing additional non-arduino ADC boards
	- Also allows for more modularity
	
- (optional) support for external/non-arduino ADC boards
	- Not immediately relevant (long term future)
	
== Experiment Goals ==

- Baseline:
	- Find material parameters for experimental fluids (mostly done, karo syrup?)
	- Calculate Pr for experimental fluids (mostly done, karo syrup?)
	- Run an experiment with full basal heating and associated sensors
	- Calculate Rayleigh number (Ra) for an experiment
	- Run an experiment with VFV sensor arrangement alongside above
	- Calculate Ra and Reynold's number (Re) for experiment
	- Repeat to find relation between Pr, Ra, Re
	- Could have low reproduction/repition time as we may not need to power off between runs
	
	- Summary of Future Goals:
		- Execute simple demonstration experiments as previously planned
	
- Internal Heating:
	- Experiment with current light sources (need to determine actual power output if possible, HFS?)
	- Prepare light insulated tank?
	- Need armature for light source
	- NEED TO VALIDATE WE CAN GET SUFFICIENT POWER DENSITY TO MAKE METHOD VIABLE
	- Assuming sufficient power density, assemble tank structure
	- Run experiment with full sensor array
	- Calculate new Ra, Re, Pr relationship for internal heating power (H)
	
	- Summary of Future Goals:
		- Need to test whether we can get sufficient lighting power density for application
		- Once (/if) validated, build on baseline tools with new apparatus
	
- Plume Merger:
	- Get results/numbers from Arthur and Kavya to analyze
	- Compare to simulations from Winter/Spring '22
	- Dimensional analysis - translate to a geophysical context
	- Run new simulations with dimensionalized values to recreate (as much as possible) physical results
	- Run 3D simulations?
	- Repeat additional plume merger experiments with sensor suite to get additional data
	- New Tank! 
		- Variable width using simple dividers
		- At least 4x width compared to height, ~30cm tall?, at least a deep as is tall
		- Inductive heating preferable (reduces heat source & adjustment process complexity)
		- Would likely be very expensive, not an immediate possibility
		- Would greatly facillitate plume merger research on a larger scale with greater refinement.
		- Better facimile for the mantle than current "make-do" tanks in terms of aspect ratio
	- Hard time limit minimum imposed by waiting for tank to settle. 
		- Need ideas to speed up the process without losing validity. 
		- Different working fluid??
		
	- Summary of Future Goals: 
		- Obtain and analyze work up to this point
		- More refined simulation and lab work
		- Need to consider in geophysical context and potentially redesign some aspects 
	
- Surface Displacement/Morphology:
	- Need to validate how sensor works and get prototype validated
	- Need to set up permanent surface displacement sensor circuitry and acquisition+analysis code
	- Need armature for sensor
		- Scanning armature would be fantastic!
		- Simple armature with steel bars, base stands, and clamps would be cheaper and easier to implement
		- Simple first, scanning maybe later if we can afford/justify it
	- Can be applied to any open-top experiment
	- More effective with surface coating?
		- Absorptive, matte, or reflective?
	- Can easily(?) train undergrad to work with system and take measurements
	- Could combine with plume merger work
		
	- Summary of Future Goals:
		- Prototype and validate surface displacement sensor system
		- Build armature for sensor
		- Use in tandem with basically any other experiment w/ open top
